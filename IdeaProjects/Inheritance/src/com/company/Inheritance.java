/*
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.
We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:
Subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class.
Superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from.
To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.
